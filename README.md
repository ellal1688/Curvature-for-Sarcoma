# Curvature for Gene Interaction Prediction in Sarcoma 

Group Research Paper as final project for 02-251, Great Ideas in Computational Biology. Implemented Ollivier-Ricci flow simulation, k-means clustering, and multi-scale functional analysis on STRING
gene regulatory network to identify novel gene interactions in Ewing Sarcoma (EWS). Gene knockout simulations were also performed to determine which targets might be most effective on targeting EWS.
The main inspiration for this project is a paper by [Elkin, et. al], from which the base code for the curvature and flow analysis is derived. 

Project received an A grade in the course.
